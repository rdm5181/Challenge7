* [pathlib](https://github.com/budlight/pathlib) - Specifies a path

* [bokeh.models.formatters](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/branch-3.0/bokeh/models/formatters.py) - Manages tick markings when plotting.

* [hvplot.pandas](https://github.com/holoviz/hvplot) - A high-level plotting API for pandas, dask, xarray, and networkx built on HoloViews.

* [sqlalchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy) - Database toolkit for Python.
